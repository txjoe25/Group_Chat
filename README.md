# Group_Chat

This repository creates an app where multiple people can chat with each other. You could connect to your web app from multiple browsers (one from Safari, one from Firefox, one from Chrome for example). Use javascript 'prompt' to get the user's name. The chatboard updates in real time and shows all the chats that occurred before the user joined the room.
